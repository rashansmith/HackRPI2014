HackRPI---website-
==================

This is a website I built at HackRPI 2014. It is the first time I built a website from scratch using HTML and CSS, and it 
definitely inspired to explore more features of websites through other projects. I hope to make the website live really soon,
as I improve the interface by learning more about CSS, PHP, and others.
